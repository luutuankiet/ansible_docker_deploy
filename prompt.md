Here’s a concise summary of your setup and guide:

---

### 🔧 **Project Overview**

A secure Docker-in-Docker (DinD) stack using **Traefik v3** for HTTPS routing and **Stunnel** to multiplex SSH over port 443.

---

### 📁 **Folder Structure**

```
dind-stack/
├── docker-compose.yml        # Defines services (Traefik, webapp)
├── traefik.yml               # Static Traefik config
├── traefik_dynamic.yml       # Dynamic config (TLS certs)
```

---

### 🚀 **Core Features**

* **Traefik as reverse proxy**, auto-detecting apps via Docker labels.
* **TLS termination** with custom or self-signed certs.
* **Only port 443 exposed**, supports both HTTPS and SSH multiplexing.
* **Webapp routing** via `Host(app.local)` with Traefik labels.
* **Dashboard** available at `https://app.local/dashboard`.

---

### 🧪 **Testing**

Add to `/etc/hosts`:

```
127.0.0.1 app.local
```

Then run:

```bash
curl -k https://app.local
```

---

### 🔐 **Stunnel for SSH over 443**

1. **Server (Dockerfile based on `docker:dind`)**

   * Installs `openssh` + `stunnel`
   * Accepts connections on port 443 → unwraps TLS → forwards to port 22

2. **Client (macOS/Linux)**

   * Stunnel config forwards local port 2222 → TLS-wrapped to remote port 443
   * SSH to `root@127.0.0.1 -p 2222`

3. **VS Code**

   * Use Remote SSH plugin with `~/.ssh/config`:

     ```ini
     Host dind-ssh
       HostName 127.0.0.1
       Port 2222
       User root
     ```

---

### ⚙️ **Workflow Summary**

```
SSH client → localhost:2222
→ Stunnel client (TLS wraps)
→ DinD host:443
→ Stunnel server (unwraps)
→ SSH server on port 22
```

---

### 📌 **Next Steps (Optional)**

* Replace self-signed certs with Let's Encrypt
* Add HTTP routing (Traefik + SNI passthrough)
* Automate stunnel start on client
* Scripted deployment / TLS bootstrapping
